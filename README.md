# GimmeDapp: a social platform for dapp development 


A social platform for the developer community to showcase their dapps and let the community upvote, downvote, or comment on the ideas. 

The developers should make ever effort to provide as much information as they can on their project and publish an ETC donation address.

### Current state: Alpha testing

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/rxy4qqaR/gimmie-dapp)


ETC DONATION ADDRESS: [0x17dAfbe0dA3f55268e543Fb85283c30Aba54CaDE](https://etherhub.io/addr/0x17dAfbe0dA3f55268e543Fb85283c30Aba54CaDE)
